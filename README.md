psd file for making your own switch covers for @HoTsHoTz79 vertical theme
I have also made 2 directories filled with premade PNG templates
One folder is `422x256` these will be for covers you make pre resize.
If you have already converted the image to `256x256` you can use the PNG templates from the resized PNG folder on top of existing images you may have already made & converted.


Here are some examples I have made as a quick mockup.

Switch cover icon with USA age rating

If you want to make your own icons a few search results can help get some assets to make your own.


```
• gamename "press kit"
• gamename/title .PNG into duckduckgo 
    >(other search engines yeild different images)
• gamename "keyart"
• developers website
• publishers website
```

Obviously wallpapers but try mobile wallpapers or change the image results to show "tall" in Google you have to click advanced search but duckduckgo has it at the top of an image search.

If I find a cover I still use my template as it usually helps me align images.

Other tid bits try other languages using translate. 
You can use https://extract.pics/ to pull images direct from sites. 
≥Sometimes if the image is saving as webp you can remove certain parts of a URL to get the direct image link or even inspect element or convert it.

Since beginning the icon repo I've pulled about `10gb` of assets using all the above techniques.
